I decided to learn Gatsby last month and this site is the result of that process. I really enjoy the better user experience Gatsby provides for React, without the need to use router or redux. Gatsby seems to tie together all the tools a developer needs to build a modern responsive website, and I really enjoyed working with it.

Gatsby makes setting up multiple page react builds a breeze, and orginasation is easy. I never found working with redux intuitive, and seemed to be a more laborious process than was neccesary. With the Link component built in to gatsby, all you have to do is create seperate files for each page in the "pages" folder, and use the Link component to link between them. All of this gets nested into a Layout component to create a layout of shared assets (Header, Footer, etc) between the pages. Each component can be styled with modules (layout.module.scss for the layout.js file), which generate unique css classes automatically, as to avoid duplicate class names across the site.

My initial interest in Web Development came when I stumbled across SEO videos on YouTube years ago. I had been considering setting up a basic wordpress or squarespace site to sell things online as a side business when I was working as a bartender. The idea of setting up a site to perform better on search engines fascinated me. I watched countless YouTube videos, and read ***The Art of SEO by Eric Enge***. Realizing I really needed to learn how to code my own sites to put what I learned into action set me on the web development path. Gatsby is a great tool for SEO since it is a static site generator. At build time it provides the server with static sites and really increases page loading time. This is an important feature if you are building sites with SEO in mind.

I highly recommend Gatsby to anyone interested in learning it.
