I wanted to highlight a couple other react projects I have worked on. One is a coronavirus tracker I built over summer. There was a lot of data to use that I was interested in, and I happened to be learning about using API calls in react at the time. Sadly (for humanity not for me) it became broken due to how large the numbers got, but I did manage to save some screenshots of it, and the code is on [github](https://github.com/KBellock).

The other project was an instagram-like site for my freinds and myself to post to. I connected the app to google's firebase, which made setting up the backend with user authentication much easier and more reliable. The problem with using firebase as a back-end is that the database expires, so the site is no longer up. I will be including some of the code on my [github](https://github.com/KBellock).
